# Rust Ping Pong

Rust Ping Pong is a simple 2D game implemented in Rust using the minifb crate. It features a player-controlled paddle, a bot-controlled paddle, and a ball that bounces between them. The goal is to prevent the ball from passing behind your paddle while trying to get it past the opponent's paddle.
